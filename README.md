# Training Tracker
### Thinkful Full-Stack Capstone Project - a responsive application that allows users to track and access personal information pertaining to fitness and lifting workout regimens.

The Training Tracker application allows users to effectively track their own fitness goals through a easy-to-understand and user-friendly user interface.

The user interface for the Training Tracker application allows for the creation of customizable workouts; the tracker supports workouts and exercises with custom names and the input of sets & repetitions completed for each exercise at a given weight.

Training Tracker is hoping to expand to include features that will allow users to view a comprehensive chart of their progress rather than the current log of workouts completed.
